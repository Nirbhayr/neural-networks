# Neural Networks

This repo includes notebooks containing implementation of neural networks, mostly using `torch`. This is still in its early phase so you may find some stray files
or improper documentation in the code. However, I plan to regulary update and add new codes as I build more. 

This goal is to make a repo for beginners who are new to python, `pytorch`, neural networks, and deep learning. A lot of repos (very good) are out there which may contain
what you are searching for. But, what I have done in this repo is to manually implement many of things under the hood, which you _may_ not get to see on medium!!

- Neural networks from scratch (using tensors and not numpy). DL frameworks like `tf` heavily use tensors but using `numpy` does not really give you the feel which you need at this stage as a beginner. Understanding tensor based operations and manipulations does take time (regardless of what "experts" tell you) so don't worry if you cannot follow a few steps. However, I have tried to heavily comment the code to the point that it may even feel spammed to
some. But, as I mentioned earlier this is for beginners. I would highly recommend the `d2L` book and its website for starting if you are an absolute beginner. You can interlace these notebooks with the book for your learning.  

Mastering deep learning concepts both theoretically and practically takes months so be patient and consistent. Code somehting daily. Try to implement something that you 
want rather than what is possible. You will fail but trust me I have learnt more than while failing to code than from the code that actually works!

I hope you read it till here. Enjoy the repo. And feel free to fork it.
