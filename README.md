# Neural Networks

This repo includes notebooks containing implementation of neural networks, mostly using `torch`. This is still in its early phase so you may find some stray files
or improper documentation in the code. However, I plan to update and add new codes as I gain more understanding and imolement more and more things. 

This goal is to make a repo for beginners who are new to python, `pytorch`, neural networks, and deep learning. A lot of repos (very good) are out there which may contain
what you are searching for. But, what I have done in this repo is to manually implement many of things under the hood, which you _may_ not get to see on medium!!

Neural networks from scratch (using `pytorch`and `not numpy`). DL frameworks like `tensorflow` heavily use tensors so using `numpy` does not really give you the feel which you need at this stage of learning. If you are trying to learn pytorch or any DL library means you have already a basic or intermediate understanding of numpy. Understanding tensor based operations and manipulations is naturally the next step. 
However, it does take time (regardless of how good you are) so don't worry if you cannot follow a few steps. Tensors are not very intuitive unless you are an astrophysicist. I have tried to heavily comment my code.
I would highly recommend the `d2L` book and its website for starting if you are an absolute beginner and this repo seems like latin to you. You can interlace these notebooks with the book for better learning. The goal here is to implement things as I gain more understanding. I may occassionally copy code from other repos and I will definitely credit them in my notebooks. 

Mastering deep learning concepts both theoretically and practically takes months so be patient and consistent. Code somehting daily. Try to implement something that you 
want rather than what is possible. You will fail but trust me I have learnt more than while failing to code than from the code that actually works!

I hope you read it till here. Enjoy the repo. And feel free to fork it.
