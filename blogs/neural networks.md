 # Blog Links
 
 <b> Check out the blogs which use the notebooks. If you have any trouble with the code you can refer to these blogs <br>
  I will keep adding more to this list as I post new blogs on my website. I could not think of any other way to post these links on github but if you do I would love to know. 
  Enjoy!
